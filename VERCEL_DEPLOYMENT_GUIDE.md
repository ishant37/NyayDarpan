# FRA Patta Generator - Vercel Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Manual Deployment Steps

Since there's an authentication issue with the CLI, here's how to deploy manually:

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Login with your GitHub account

2. **Import Project**
   - Click "Add New..." → "Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository: `ishant37/NyayDarpan`
   - Or upload the project folder directly

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Framework Preset: `Vite`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

4. **Environment Variables** (if needed)
   - Add any environment variables your app requires

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy" and wait for the build to complete

### Option 2: Git Integration (Automatic Deployments)

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect Repository in Vercel**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard
   - Click "Add New..." → "Project"
   - Import from Git and select your repository
   - Follow the same configuration steps as Option 1

### Option 3: Fix CLI Issues and Deploy

If you want to use CLI deployment:

1. **Check Git Configuration**
   ```bash
   git config user.name "Your Name"
   git config user.email "your-email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Re-authenticate Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel logout
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy as New Project**
   ```bash
   vercel --force
   ```

## 📁 Project Structure for Deployment

Your project is already configured with:

✅ `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration
✅ `.vercelignore` - Files to ignore during deployment
✅ `dist/` folder - Built production files
✅ Proper routing configuration for SPA

## 🔧 Build Configuration

The `vercel.json` file contains:
- Framework: Vite
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`
- SPA routing configuration

## 🎯 Expected Results

After successful deployment, you'll get:
- **Preview URL**: For testing
- **Production URL**: For live use
- **Automatic HTTPS**: SSL certificate
- **CDN**: Global content delivery
- **Custom Domain**: (optional) You can add your own domain

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Build Errors:**
- All dependencies are installed
- Build completes successfully locally
- Large bundle warning (2.5MB) - consider code splitting for better performance

**Deployment Issues:**
- Use Vercel Dashboard if CLI fails
- Check GitHub repository permissions
- Ensure all files are committed and pushed
